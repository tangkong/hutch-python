"""
This module modifies an ``ipython`` shell to automatically close if it has been 
idle for 48 hours. Prior to starting hutch-python the user is alerted that the 
shell will automatically close after another 24 hours and is given the option 
to enter the number of hours they want to extend the session.

class IPythonSessionTimer:
    '''
    Class tracks the amount of time the current `InteractiveShell` instance (henceforth
    called 'user session') has been idle and closes the session if more than 48
    hours have passed.

    Time is in seconds (floating point) since the epoch began. (In UNIX the
    epoch started on January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC)

    Parameters
    ----------
    ipython : ``IPython.terminal.interactiveshell.TerminalInteractiveShell``
        The active ``ipython`` ``Shell``, perhaps the one returned by
        ``IPython.get_ipython()``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    curr_time: float
        The current time in seconds.

    max_idle_time: int
        The maximum number of seconds a user session can be idle (currently set 
        to 172800 seconds or 48 hours).

    last_active_time: float
        The time of the last user activity in this session.

    idle_time: float
        The amount of time the user session has been idle.
